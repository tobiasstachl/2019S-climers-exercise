Southern Oscillation Index

The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is a standardized index based on the observed sea level pressure differences
between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia. The SOI is one measure of the large-scale fluctuations in air pressure
occurring between the western and eastern tropical Pacific (i.e., the state of the Southern Oscillation)
during El Niño and La Niña episodes.

In general, smoothed time series of the SOI correspond very well with changes in ocean temperatures across the eastern
tropical Pacific. The negative phase of the SOI represents below-normal air pressure at Tahiti and above-normal air
pressure at Darwin. Prolonged periods of negative (positive) SOI values coincide with abnormally warm (cold) ocean
waters across the eastern tropical Pacific typical of El Niño (La Niña) episodes. The methodology used to calculate
SOI is available below.

In summary:
-----------
El Niño: negative SOI <-> positive SST & Sea level anomalies
La Niña: positive SOI <-> negative SST & Sea level anomalies
